#JQuery Eclipse 

This is the sourcecode for The JQuery Eclipse plugin developed originally at the Univeristy of British Columbia.

See http://jquery.cs.ubc.ca/

This is not to be confused with "jquery" the JavaScript library. The JQuery Eclipse code-browser 
actually predates the javascript library of the same name.
